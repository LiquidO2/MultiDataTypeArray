This is an array data structure that can be used to store data of different data types in a single dimensional array.

- This implementation works with four basic data types: int, float, double and char. 
- In a later version, I will try to add support for other datatypes as well.
- Please do understand that this is still a work in progress. There might be unsquashed bugs. 
- While the code is somewhat clean, it still lacks comments, I am too lazy to do it now. I may add the comments in a later commit. 
- I will hopefully also add proper documentation here whenever I have the time to do so. For now, I am still working on the code.  

#####System requirement: 
- C++ 14 or newer
